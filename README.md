# Movie-Recommendations

This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on a user input. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compare and match movie titles, providing personalized recommendations. The dataset is preprocessed for accurate title matching, and an interactive search feature is implemented using ipywidgets in a Jupyter notebook. The project also uses Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NumPy for data handling, vectorization, and similarity computation. This project offers an intuitive, real-time recommendation experience, ideal for exploring content-based recommendation algorithms.
